# Instagram Clone Data Analysis
 This [project](<IG Clone Project.sql>) aims to analyze an Instagram clone dataset using MySQL. It deals with user behaviour, likes, comments, hashtags and much more. 

# Dataset
 The [dataset](ig_clone_data.sql) is named 'ig_clone'. It contains the following columns:
 1. comments
 2. follows
 3. likes
 4. photo_tags
 5. photos
 6. tags
 7. users

# Concepts Involved
This project deals with Basic SQL functions and queries. The various concepts of MySQL used in this project range from aggreagte functions, Joins, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, HAVING, etc.

# Prerequisite
The only prerequisite to dive deep into a data analysis project is to understand the data. For better understanding of the dataset, do not forget to see the ER diagram. I have created this [Entity Relationship Diagram](<ig_clone ER Diagram.mwb>) that provides a neat visual appearance of the various tables and columns of the dataset.
